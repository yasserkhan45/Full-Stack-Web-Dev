                Don’t &nbsp you just love exploring beautiful and neat 
                sites with a clean user interface? While most of us 
                would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we 
                know the kind of effort and skill that goes into 
                making a website attractive and user-friendly. 
                The secret to creating an impressive site is to 
                master the art of front-end development, and no, 
                it is not as easy as it seems!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it is not impossible either. 
                Here are five tips that’ll help you get better

                        Commenting 
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Commenting is one such practice that is 
                        often ignored by programmers, especially 
                        for codes that are written by multiple 
                        programmers. But remember, commenting is an 
                        important part of project you create. With 
                        proper comments and organised files its always 
                        easier for you or others to jump in and understand 
                        where things are at and how they work.
